            <p>Our comprehensive video course will guide you step by step in the process – from launching your first website to starting your own career! </p>

            <p>This Full Stack course has over 50 hours of content. You can go back and review it at any time by logging into your members area. We use the most efficient teaching methods to take you from zero to ninja in just 8 weeks.</p>

            <h1>What makes our video course different? </h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Benjamin Louie, and I have been a web developer for the past 14 years and I have been teaching web development for 1 year. Unlike other professors, I teach from work experience in my career. Many online courses can teach theory only, as they have not worked a single day in the field. My classes also teach theory, but we spend more time on real world examples.</p>

            <p>I know what companies want from an employee and what employers look for in interviews. My classes cover projects I have done for corporations. In addition to coding, I give some invaluable interview advice in the courses.</p>

            <p>Unlike other courses, where the teacher speaks to an empty room, you will watch me interact with my students who took the bootcamp, where they ask me questions, questions that you might have. In these classes, students submit websites to me so I can recreate them from scratch using the concepts they’ve learned thus far. As far as I know, no one does this. </p>

            <p>Each module has exercises for you to practice what you’ve learned. Also included in this video course are projects you can do to put your skills to the test. It is recommended you do not skip the projects, otherwise you wll not become a true code ninja.</p>
