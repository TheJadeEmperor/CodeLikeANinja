            <h1>What makes our video course different? </h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Benjamin Louie, and I have been a web developer for the past 14 years and I have been teaching web development for 1 year. Unlike other professors, I teach from work experience in my career. Many online courses can teach theory only, as they have not worked a single day in the field. My classes also teach theory, but we spend more time on real world examples.</p>

            <p>I know what companies want from an employee and what employers look for in interviews. My classes cover projects I have done for corporations. </p>

            <p>Unlike other courses, where the teacher speaks to an empty room, you will watch me interact with my students who took the bootcamp, where they ask me questions, questions that you might have. In these classes, students submit websites to me so I can recreate them from scratch using the concepts they’ve learned thus far. As far as I know, no one does this. </p>

            <p>Each module has exercise for you to practice what you’ve learned. Also included in this video course are projects you can do to put your skills to the test.  </p>
